\f0\fs24 \cf0 There are GUI\'92s (graphical user interfaces) and CLI\'92s ( Command line Interfaces). These are two different approaches to interacting with a computer. GUI uses windows, buttons, and icons to move around the computer. These buttons and Icons are visually appealing making it user-friendly and has a shallow learning curve so it's easy for the general public to use. Users can perform tasks without memorizing commands and just use the labeled buttons or icons. \

CLI uses text-based commands and offers efficiency for users with more experience with computers while using fewer resources. CLI uses your operating system to interact and do tasks with your computer. You can do basic tasks like moving a file, changing the name of a file, creating an empty file, creating a new directory, and be able to delete a file with ease. The CLI has many commands and a specific way things must be entered for the computer to understand the prompt. It takes a while for computer users to memorize these prompts but the effort can be worth it in the long run. }
